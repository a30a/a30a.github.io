In this context, I expect it to have a fair amount of “legs”. On the other hand, it is a disaster in the making as a general hierarchical data format. I fully expect RDBMSs to subsume JSON as merely a data type (among many) in their systems. In other words, it is a reasonable way to encode spare relational data.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`More recently, there has been another thrust in HDFS land which merit discussion, namely “data lakes”. A reasonable use of an HDFS cluster (which by now most enterprises have invested in and want to find something useful for them to do) is as a queue of data files which have been ingested.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`In summary, in the last decade nobody seems to have heeded the lessons in “comes around”.

Also, the threading model and process structure is as relevant today as a decade ago. As such, the reader should note that the details of concurrency control, crash recovery, optimization, data structures and indexing are in a state of rapid change, but the basic architecture of DBMSs remains intact.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h3>{`Chapter 2: Traditional RDBMS Systems`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Introduced by Michael Stonebraker`}</p>\n    <p>{`Selected Readings:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Morton M.

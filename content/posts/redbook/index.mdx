# 요약

### Preface

읽기 목록은 다음 핵심 범주에 부합하는 주제와 논문으로 선정하였다.

첫째, 선택된 것들 각각은 데이터 관리에서 주요 트렌드를 드러내야한다.

둘째, 선택된 것들은 표준적이거나 혹은 그에 준하는 것들이다. 우리는 각 항목에 대한 가장 대표적인 논문을 고르고자 했다.

셋째, 선택된 것들은 1차 문헌이어야 한다. 훌륭한 해설서들이 많이 있지만, 1차 문헌을 읽음으로써만 얻을 수 있는 역사적 맥락과 영향력 있는 솔루션을 빚게한 생각에 노출될 수 있다.

넷째, 이 모음집은 저자들이 "가장 중요하다고" 생각하는 것들을 담고 있다. 독자들은 비판적인 시각으로 읽어주길 바란다.

# 인용

### Chapter 1: Background

Introduced by Michael Stonebraker

> A decade ago, the buzz was all XML. Vendors were intent on adding XML to their relational engines. Industry analysts (and more than a few researchers) were touting XML as “the next big thing”.

> In summary, JSON is a reasonable choice for sparse data. In this context, I expect it to have a fair amount of “legs”. On the other hand, it is a disaster in the making as a general hierarchical data format. I fully expect RDBMSs to subsume JSON as merely a data type (among many) in their systems. In other words, it is a reasonable way to encode spare relational data.

> More recently, there has been another thrust in HDFS land which merit discussion, namely “data lakes”. A reasonable use of an HDFS cluster (which by now most enterprises have invested in and want to find something useful for them to do) is as a queue of data files which have been ingested.

> However, the basic architecture of these new systems continues to follow the parsing/optimizer/executor structure described in the paper. Also, the threading model and process structure is as relevant today as a decade ago. As such, the reader should note that the details of concurrency control, crash recovery, optimization, data structures and indexing are in a state of rapid change, but the basic architecture of DBMSs remains intact.
